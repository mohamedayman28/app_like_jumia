# Django E-commerce

Imitation for [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.eg/) E-commerce.

**NOTE:** In settings.py, if you will use SQLite as your backend database uncomment SQLite settings.

**NOTE:** I'm using PostgreSQL, if you use SQLite max_lenght related tests will fail, that's because SQLite use TEXT for models.CharField.
